## Summary ##

: Using geolocation and virtual augmentation the user gets hints or ‘crumbs’ as they will be called to lead them on a live/virtual tour of their surroundings. This provides the ability for the ‘Crumblayer’ to leave clues, videos, sounds or virtual drawing to provide the client with an interactive experience.
